# Stock Signal Application

The Stock Signal application is designed to assist in stock market prediction and trading strategy development using various technical and fundamental indicators. This project leverages several types of analysis, such as trend-following, value investing, and economic indicators to make informed buy and sell decisions.

## Features

-   **Strategy Implementation:** Includes various trading strategies such as:
    -   Trend Following (e.g., Moving Average, MACD)
    -   Value Investing (e.g., P/E Ratio, Earnings Growth)
-   **Technical & Fundamental Indicators:** Uses indicators like MACD, Moving Average, and economic indicators such as GDP Growth and Interest Rate.
-   **Backtesting Engine:** The application includes a backtesting engine to test the performance of the trading strategies based on historical stock data.
-   **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Collects and preprocesses stock data to ensure quality analysis and strategy execution.
-   **Risk Management:** Includes basic risk management techniques to assess and mitigate potential trading risks.
-   **AI-Enhanced Code:** This project was developed with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), including code generation, documentation, and guidance. The use of AI helped accelerate development, improve code quality, and generate detailed comments for better understanding. The AI's role has been transparent, providing useful suggestions and aiding in writing boilerplate code and logic.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Stock Signal application, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
-   Maven for dependency management (optional)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/stock-signal.git](https://github.com/yourusername/stock-signal.git)
    cd stock-signal
    ```
2.  Build the project (if using Maven):
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
3.  Run the application:
    To run the Stock Signal application, execute the following command:
    ```bash
    java -jar target/stock-signal.jar
    ```

## Configuration

The app can be customized via configuration files or in the code itself. Configuration details for strategies, data sources, and risk management can be added in the respective classes (e.g., `AppConfig`).

## Usage

Once the app is started, it performs the following tasks:

1.  Loads the configuration
2.  Collects stock data (from external APIs or predefined data sources)
3.  Preprocesses the data (normalization, cleaning, etc.)
4.  Executes the chosen trading strategy (e.g., Trend Following or Value Investing)
5.  Evaluates the performance and risk

You can modify the strategies and indicators based on your needs and experiment with different configurations.

## AI Assistance

This project has been heavily supported by artificial intelligence (AI) in various stages, from coding to documentation. Specifically, the AI helped in:

-   Writing code for the core logic of trading strategies, data handling, and indicators.
-   Generating Javadoc comments for better understanding and maintenance of the codebase.
-   Suggesting optimizations and improvements during development.

While the AI-generated content has been reviewed and tested by human developers, the use of AI significantly sped up development and helped with consistency across different parts of the application.
