# StockSignal

StockSignal is a stock analysis and prediction application designed to help investors make data-driven decisions. It combines fundamental analysis indicators, stock data from Alpha Vantage, and machine learning algorithms to assess stock performance. The project is built to evaluate stocks using strategies like value investing, leveraging financial metrics such as the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio and earnings growth.

**Note:** This project is in a working state but is not finished. It is actively being developed with additional features and refinements planned for future releases.

## Features

* **Alpha Vantage Integration:** Fetch stock data, including daily prices and earnings per share (EPS).
* **Fundamental Analysis Indicators:** Calculate and use key financial indicators such as PE Ratio and Earnings Growth.
* **Investment Strategies:** Implement value investing strategy based on PE ratio and earnings growth.
* **Logging and Error Handling:** Incorporate robust logging and error handling for transparency and traceability.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/StockSignal.git](https://github.com/yourusername/StockSignal.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd StockSignal
    ```
3.  Build the project using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
4.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    mvn exec:java
    ```

## Dependencies

* **Logback:** For logging application messages.
* **SLF4J:** For providing a simple logging facade.
* **Alpha Vantage API:** For retrieving stock data (API key required).
* JDK 17 or later is recommended for running the project.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can modify the `Main.java` file to test different stock symbols and evaluate them using various strategies. The current implementation includes a basic value investing strategy that evaluates whether a stock is a good buy or sell based on its PE ratio and earnings growth.

For example, you can test a stock like Google (GOOGL) by using:

```java
StockData stockData = fetcher.collectLatestDailyData("GOOGL");
```

## Project Structure

* `com.stocksignal.data`: Contains classes responsible for fetching and processing stock data.
    * `AlphaVantageFetcher.java`: Fetches data from the Alpha Vantage API.
    * `StockData.java`: Represents a stock's daily trading data.
* `com.stocksignal.indicators.fundamental`: Contains classes for financial indicators like PE ratio and earnings growth.
    * `PE_Ratio.java`: Calculates the Price-to-Earnings ratio.
    * `EarningsGrowth.java`: Calculates the earnings growth percentage.
* `com.stocksignal.strategies`: Contains investment strategies based on the indicators.
    * `ValueInvestingStrategy.java`: Implements a basic value investing strategy.
* `com.stocksignal.utils`: Contains utility classes like logging.
    * `AppLogger.java`: A custom logging utility that wraps SLF4J for easier logging.

## Javadoc Comments & Code Refactoring

This project employs Javadoc comments to document the purpose, parameters, and return types of classes and methods. The goal is to maintain clarity in the codebase and improve the maintainability of the project.

### AI-Assisted Code Writing and Refactoring

Several portions of the code were written and refactored with the assistance of AI. This includes:

* **Code Writing:** The initial structure of classes and methods was generated by AI based on the functional requirements.
* **Code Refactoring:** AI was also used to refactor and improve the existing code by suggesting optimizations and identifying potential issues.
* **Javadoc Generation:** AI was employed to write comprehensive Javadoc comments to ensure clear documentation of the codebase.

While AI has been instrumental in speeding up development, the core logic and functionality have been thoroughly reviewed and tested by the developer.
